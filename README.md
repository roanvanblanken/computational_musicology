# Computational Musicology Project

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the musical preferences of an individual and to develop a model to predict their musical taste. The analysis is conducted using various tools and techniques, such as chromagrams, ceptrograms, tempograms, and self-similarity matrices.

## File Structure

- `data`: Contains the processed data, including the "New Music Friday" playlist.
- `index_files`: Contains files made by knitting the index.Rmd file.
- `.gitignore`: Ignores irrelevant files in the repository.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and its file structure.
- `computational_musicology.Rproj`: The R project file.
- `index.Rmd`: The main file for the project, containing the analysis and results.
- `index.html`: The rendered HTML file of the index.Rmd file.
- `make_ceptrograms.R`: Script to generate ceptrograms.
- `make_model.R`: Script to train and evaluate the decision tree classification model.
- `make_self_similarity_matrices.R`: Script to generate self-similarity matrices.
- `make_tempograms.R`: Script to generate tempograms.
- `testing.Rmd`: A testing file containing unused code.
- `testing.html`: The rendered HTML file of the testing.Rmd file.

## Conclusion
The analysis of the musical preferences of an individual using various tools and techniques, such as chromagrams, ceptrograms, tempograms, and self-similarity matrices, provided valuable insights into the factors that influence musical taste. The study revealed the key features that differentiate between the "Songs I Like" and "Songs I Dislike" playlists, which can be used by music streaming platforms to provide more personalized music recommendations. Additionally, music producers and composers could use these findings to tailor their compositions to appeal to specific audiences. The decision tree classification model was successfully trained to predict personal musical preferences based on these identified features and can be used for predicting the preferences of other listeners.

## Project Status
The project is complete, and the findings are presented in the `index.Rmd` file. The `README.md` file provides an overview of the project and its file structure.
